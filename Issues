-Need random generator for generating large *Integer* between (Integer_min,
 Integer_max). Existing function in Random.hpp allows random *int* between
 (int_min, int_max).

-How to initialize Integer variable with hexadecimal string representation of
 a number? There seems to be no such constructor which accepts hex string.
 I need this to test the code with parameters initialized using hex strings.

-For test code, I included only DissentTest.hpp, taking Henry's AuthenticateTest
 code as reference. But upon compilation, it gives undefined reference error for
 LRSAuthenticat* class objects. Do I need to include LRSAuthenticat*.hpp headers
 in LRSAuthenticatorTest.cpp file too?

-No method for Local_Id to int conversion. Ordered numbering of members in the
 group is required. If it is to be derived from existing Id class object then
 appropriate methods should be added to get *int* member identity from Id.
 Also, when and how is Member identity - assigned?

-Wrapper for maintaining group parameters is needed. At present all group para-
 meters are maintained in private variables of LRSAuthenticat* class.
